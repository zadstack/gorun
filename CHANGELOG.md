## [Unreleased]

### First public release

- GoRun is published as open source under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (see
  `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`).
- The command line lives in the importable package `pkg/cli`; `cmd/gorun` is a thin wrapper.
  A separate binary can add modules, commands, boot-order entries, error-inventory categories and
  a trusted site-policy directory through `cli.Option`s (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Building on
  the core"). Every core command and flag is unchanged.
- The trusted directory for `GORUN_SITE_POLICY` files defaults to `/var/lib/gorun-site-policies`;
  a downstream build can set another one with `cli.WithSitePolicyDirectory`.
- Hosting-platform add-ons, brand themes and the commands that served them (`tenant-init`,
  `addon-install`, `page-catalog`) are no longer part of the core.
